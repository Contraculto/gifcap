GIFcap
======

GIFcap right now is a couple of BASH scripts to take screenshots and instantly upload them to your server via FTP or SSH. Pretty much what vvcap does in Windows, with the added abbility to take X screenshots in a sequence and uploading a GIF.

This version just has the basic functionality, but needs some cleaning, a couple of options and some love. It's still really simple, just a few lines. Eventually it will be just one script with parameters.

To use this you will need Xclip, Zenity and either FTP or SSH (SCP) access to a web server.

Original screenshooter idea and code by JP Verdejo.
